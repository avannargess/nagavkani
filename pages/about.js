            <p>Born and raised in a faraway land,<strong> N. A. Gavkani</strong> has always followed her curiosity about the <strong> "Why"</strong> and the <strong> "How"</strong> of the world around her. 
            That pursuit led to a love of physics and a passion for philosophy. Influenced by the teachings of Persia’s Rumi and Khayyam, as well as Western thinkers such as Nietzsche, she finds storytelling the most meaningful way to share the world within her with the one outside.</p>
            <p>By training, she holds a PhD in Physics — a background that shapes her love for building rich, internally consistent worlds and magic systems. She has completed Book One of the <strong>Dragon & Daffodil</strong> trilogy and is currently seeking representation.</p>
